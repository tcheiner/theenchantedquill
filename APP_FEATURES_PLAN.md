            YouTubePlayer(stringLiteral: videoID)
        )
        .frame(height: 300)
        .darkAcademiaTheming()
    }
}
```

### Social Sharing Implementation

**Native iOS Sharing:**
```swift
struct ShareButton: View {
    let videoURL: String
    let bookTitle: String
    
    private func presentShareSheet() {
        let shareText = "Check out this book review: \(bookTitle) 📚"
        let items: [Any] = [shareText, URL(string: videoURL)!]
        
        let activityVC = UIActivityViewController(
            activityItems: items,
            applicationActivities: nil
        )
        // Automatically includes TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
    }
}
```
